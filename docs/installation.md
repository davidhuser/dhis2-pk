Installation and Usage
======================

Installation
------------

Installation with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing)
(python package manager, see if it is installed: `pip -V`)

Best way is to install it for your user only:

```bash
pip install dhis2-pocket-knife --user --upgrade
```

This way you don't clutter your system installation, but it might be
that you see a message like *dhis2-pk-share could not be found*. To fix
this you need to modify your Python PATH.

**macOS**

Replace `$USER` with your macOS username and paste it into your terminal.

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/Users/$USER/Library/Python/2.7/bin' >> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile && dhis2-pk-share --help
```

To install it system-wide **(not recommended)**:

```bash
sudo -H pip install dhis2-pocket-knife
```

Updating
--------

```bash
pip install dhis2-pocket-knife --user --upgrade
```

Usage
-----

If you're using the same server over and over, place file called
`dish.json` in your home folder and leave out `server`, `username`,
`password` in all commands. 
Make sure that file is kept in a secure place. (`chmod 0600 dish.json`)

So: either pass arguments for a server / username / password or
make it read from a `dish.json` file as described in
[davidhuser/dhis2.py](https://github.com/davidhuser/dhis2.py#load-authentication-from-file).

Windows
--------

Windows is supported, however _do not use single apostrophes_ `'`

 * use PowerShell OR 
 * use double apostrophes `"` OR 
 * use no apostrophes at all (no problem when not having whitespaces in filters)

Help text
---------
Get help on using arguments, e.g. `dhis2-pk-share --help`
